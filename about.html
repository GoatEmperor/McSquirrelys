    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;"> At McSquirrely's we strive to give you the most squirrely taste with each nibble. With the finest local foods from our backyard. Cooked on the nicest of flames and seasoned with the best stuff we can find. Our food is 100% natural and free ranged within the city block. Serving all day we can fill you up quickly like a squirrel. <br> Each week* our workers hide food all over the yard and if you can find then it's free! This includes peanuts, walnuts, bread, sandwiches, baked goods, pine pickles, smoked cheese goods, cheese like foods, and love and hugs from our owner. Be quick before others eat all seven** hidden items! <br> Just knock on the back window and a worker or our owner will open it and serve you. If you hear a shoo then we are closed and sorry for being unable to serve you our meals. If you don't get your meal in 30 minutes or more then it's free***. <br> <br></p>
